ABSTRACT
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-0507.pdf 

The named entity tagger is used to identify tem-
poral expressions, place names, and weather events.
The tagger consults the domain-dependent ontology
for recognizing weather events, and the domain-
independent ontology for place names. The ontol-
ogy for the weather events consists of event con-
cepts, which are similar to Synset in W
ORD
N
ET
(Fellbaum, 1998).

The temporal data normalizer converts temporal
expressions such as
today
,
this  weekend
and
now
into absolute values that can be used in querying to
the database.

That is, there is a finite number of expected ques-
tion topics. Each expected question topic is defined
as a single
query  frame
.

Each frame has a rule for SQL generation.

As represented in Figure 2, the extracted event,
temporal and spatial keywords are used for selecting
an appropriate query frame. Currently, we are us-
ing a hand-coded decision tree-like classifier for se-
lecting an appropriate query frame for the extracted
keywords. 
Machine learned
classifier is being developed

KbQAS makes use of the JAPE grammars in the
GATE framework [11] to specify semantic annotation-
based regular expression patterns for question analy-
sis, in which existing linguistic processing modules for
Vietnamese including word segmentation and part-of-
speech tagging [43] are wrapped as GATE plug-ins.

ABSTRACT
http://arxiv.org/pdf/cmp-lg/9503016.pdf

Syntax-based systems syntax-based systems the user’s question is parsed 
(i.e.analysed syntactically), and the resulting parse tree is directly mapped to 
an expression in some database query language.
Syntax-based systems use a grammar 
that describes the possible syntactic structures of the user’s questions.

arc-standard
system  (Nivre,  2004),  one  of  the
most  popular  transition  systems.

Conventional approaches extract indicator fea-
tures such as the conjunction of
1~3
elements
from the stack/buffer using their words, POS tags
or arc labels.  Table 1 lists a typical set of feature
templates chosen from the ones of (Huang et al.,
2009;  Zhang  and  Nivre,  2011).

These  features
suffer from the following problems:

1. Sparsity. 
The features, especially lexicalized
features are highly sparse.
The  results  given  in  Table  2
demonstrate that: (1) lexicalized features are
indispensable; (2) Not only are the word-pair
features ... vital for pre-
dictions,  the  three-word  conjunctions ...
are  also  very
important.

2. Incompletness
3. Expensive feature computation
