## Get started:
1. Make sure you have all dependencies you need using `requirements.txt`
2. Create sample database running `create_source_db.sql`
3. You will also need two tables with locations, so first run `locations.sql`, after that run `location_relations.sql`

## Contents:

model.py             -- basic classes and structures

attributes.py        -- basic attributes functionality (location and time detection will be rewritten)

dispatcher.py        -- TODO: implement

database_wrappers.py -- sql-queries are here

console_prototype.py -- main file
